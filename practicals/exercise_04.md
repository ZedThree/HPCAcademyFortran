Exercise 04
===========

By the end of this set of problems, you will be familiar with:

- Modules
- Derived types
- Interfaces

All `program`s _must_ contain `implicit none`. While not strictly
necessary, it will eliminate an entire class of bugs.

You should use the lecture materials for help/inspiration, but please
don't copy and paste! There is some value to be had in typing up the
programs yourself.

There may be several ways to solve each problem. If you have time, you
might like to try different approaches.

Integrate a function
--------------------

1. Take your modified Euler integration program from the previous
   exercises and modify it so that you can pass in a function that
   takes the current values of $y$ and $t$ and returns the
   $frac{dy}{dt}$
